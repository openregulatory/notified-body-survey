# OpenRegulatory Notified Body Survey Data

This is the data of our notified body survey. [Read the announcement blog post][announcement].

Some quick notes on data types and how our fancy preprocessing (spoiler: it was me, sitting in front of my
computer at night, editing a spreadsheet):

* Company names were removed - this is anonymized data after all.
* Wait time durations (for QMS / Techdoc audit) were initially a string field but were now converted to an
  integer with the unit being months.
* If a wait time range would be entered, we would take the average value. "3-5 months" would become "4
  months", while "2-3 months" would become "2 months" - we're nice people after all and will give the notified
  body the benefit of the doubt here.
